           <p> Doug Dietz  realized that young patients' actual experience with diagnostic technology was awful. Children were often so terrified to lie alone inside the huge, noisy machine.  Kids had to be sedated just to get through the experience. Watch as he explains how he solved this dilemna.</p>

            <h4 class="tagline">Healthcare: Collaborating for Better Systems</h4>
   
      <p>The importance of user-centered design in healthcare is truly life or death.  Whether it's new medical devices or technologies; drug research, approval or delivery; patient forms or medical record sharing; emergency disaster planning or increasing the functionality of hospitals and everyday healthcare delivery, everyone is affected in some way by the intersection of usability in healthcare.  There are many commonalities, yet each region of the world faces its own set of unique challenges.  We believe that focusing World Usability Day 2013 on healthcare will create a stronger awareness of these issues and lead to initiative that have long term impact on the quality of everyone's life.</p>
