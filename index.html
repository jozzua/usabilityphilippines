      <h3 class="title">World Usability Day 2013</h3>
      <h4 class="tagline">Healthcare: Collaborating for Better Systems</h4>
    
      <p>As a principal designer for GE Healthcare, Doug had been designing diagnostic imaging equipment for more than 20 years when he realized that young patients' actual experience of this cutting -- edge technology was, well, awful. Children were often so terrified by the prospect of lying alone inside the huge, noisy machine that they often had to be sedated just to get through the experience. How did he solve it?</p>

      <h4><i class="icon-medkit icon-large"></i> User Centered Design in Healthcare</h4>
      <p>The importance of user-centered design in healthcare is truly life or death.  Whether it's new medical devices or technologies; drug research, approval or delivery; patient forms or medical record sharing; emergency disaster planning or increasing the functionality of hospitals and everyday healthcare delivery, everyone is affected in some way by the intersection of usability in healthcare.  There are many commonalities, yet each region of the world faces its own set of unique challenges.  We believe that focusing World Usability Day 2013 on healthcare will create a stronger awareness of these issues and lead to initiative that have long term impact on the quality of everyone's life.</p>
